# Overview

This project was developed as part of the **PCS3858 - Laborat√≥rio de Sistemas Embarcados** class undertaken during the 2025.1 semester.

The goal of the project was to build a LED cube: a set of LEDs arranged in a three-dimensional array, that can then be used to produce passive or interactive animations. Ideally, the arrangement is such that you can manipulate each LED independently. For this project, we decided to build an 8x8x8 cube, thus requiring 512 LEDs in total.

This repository documents the firmware that drives the cube and generates the animations. Although much of the overall effort in this project went into assembling its physical structure &mdash; soldering the LEDs into 1D lines, then 2D frames, and finally the 3D cube &mdash; that work is outside the scope of this repository.
